# University_Predictions
Implementation of a machine learning-based system aimed at assisting students in the process of university shortlisting based on their individual profiles.

Created a predictive model for university admissions using machine learning methodologies, which evaluates an individualâ€™s
likelihood of being accepted into a college by considering factors like GRE and TOEFL scores, Statement of Purpose (SOP),
CGPA, Letter of Recommendation (LOR), research experience, and university ranking. Explored multiple machine learning
techniques and selected the most effective one by comparing their performance to forecast admission outcome.
